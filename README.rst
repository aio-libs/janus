Mixed sync-async queue, supposed to be used for communicating between
classic synchronous (threaded) code and asynchronous (in terms of
`asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_) one.

Like `Janus god <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus>`_ the queue
object from the library has two faces: synchronous and asynchronous
interface.

Synchronous is fully compatible with `standard queue
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html>`_, asynchronous one
follows `asyncio queue design
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-queue.html>`_.

Usage
=====

Three queues are available:

* ``Queue``
* ``LifoQueue``
* ``PriorityQueue``

Each has two properties: ``sync_q`` and ``async_q``.

Use the first to get synchronous interface and the second to get asynchronous
one.


Example
-------

.. code:: python

    import asyncio
    import janus


    def threaded(sync_q: janus.SyncQueue[int]) -> None:
        for i in range(100):
            sync_q.put(i)
        sync_q.join()


    async def async_coro(async_q: janus.AsyncQueue[int]) -> None:
        for i in range(100):
            val = await async_q.get()
            assert val == i
            async_q.task_done()


    async def main() -> None:
        queue: janus.Queue[int] = janus.Queue()
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        fut = loop.run_in_executor(None, threaded, queue.sync_q)
        await async_coro(queue.async_q)
        await fut
        queue.close()
        await queue.wait_closed()


    asyncio.run(main())


Limitations
===========

This library is built using a classic thread-safe design. The design is
time-tested, but has some limitations.

* Once you are done working with a queue, you must properly close it using
  ``close()`` and ``wait_closed()``. This is because this library creates new
  tasks to notify other threads. If you do not properly close the queue,
  `asyncio may generate error messages
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/janus/issues/574>`_.
* The library has acceptable performance only when used as intended, that is,
  for communication between synchronous code and asynchronous one.
  For sync-only and async-only cases, use queues from
  `queue <https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html>`_ and
  `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-queue.html>`_ modules,
  otherwise `the slowdown will be significant
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/janus/issues/419>`_.
* You cannot use queues for communicating between two different event loops
  because, like all asyncio primitives, they bind to the current one.

Development status is production/stable. The ``janus`` library is maintained to
support the latest versions of Python and fixes, but no major changes will be
made. If your application is performance-sensitive, or if you need any new
features such as ``anyio`` support, try the
`culsans <https://github.com/x42005e1f/culsans>`_ library as an alternative.
